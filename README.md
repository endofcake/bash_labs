# Bash labs
These labs are intended as a starting point for developers new to command line (and bash in particular). Many of the instructions are targeted at Windows users, but Mac users will likely find something interesting as well.

## Prerequisites
* good text editor (I will be using Visual Studio Code, but Sublime text and Atom work equally well)
* Docker for some labs

## Contents
* [Lab 1](./lab_1) — Installing console and tools
* [Lab 2](./lab_2) — Customising the shell – Readline
* [Lab 3](./lab_3) — Customising the shell – bash profile
* [Lab 4](./lab_4) — Useful commands
* [Lab 5](./lab_5) — Vim basics

## How to use
Navigate to the lab folder, read the `README` for the lab and follow the instructions.
